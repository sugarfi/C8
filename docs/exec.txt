OOF Executable Format
OOF is the format for C8 OS. OOF stands for OOF Object Format.
FORMAT
- The first 4 bytes of an OOF file is the magic number: The ASCII
  letters OOF followed by a NUL character.
- Then comes the program header.
    - The first 4 bytes of the program header are the address that
      the program was linked at, ie. the address the program thinks
      it starts from. When running a program, you should use paging
      to map this address to something different.
    - The next 4 bytes are the entry point of the program. This is
      relative to the address above.
    - Then there are 20 bytes of 0s to fill space in case we need it
      in future versions of the format.
- After that is the assembled code as a 32 bit binary.
